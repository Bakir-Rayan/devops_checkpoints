OS used ==> Ubuntu 20.04
java version used ==> openjdk 11.0.11

I- So to install Jenkins, first, we need to check if java and OpenSSH are installed then we proceed to install Jenkins and enable it to start on each reboot

    1- Check if java and OpenSSH are installed :
    
        ** for java :
            java --version
        
        if the output is like below : 
            
            openjdk 11.0.11 2021-04-20
            OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.11+9-Ubuntu-0ubuntu2.20.04)
            OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 11.0.11+9-Ubuntu-0ubuntu2.20.04, mixed mode, sharing)
        
        that means Java is installed, otherwise, we can install it by :

            sudo apt update     # we update the repositories
            sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk     # we install java (the recommended version for the last release of Jenkins)
            java --version       # we check the installation of java

        ** for ssh :

            sudo systemctl status ssh

        if the output is like below :

            ● ssh.service - OpenBSD Secure Shell server
            Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/ssh.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
            Active: active (running) since Fri 2021-09-17 17:47:45 CET; 14min ago
            Docs: man:sshd(8)
            man:sshd_config(5)
            Process: 1192 ExecStartPre=/usr/sbin/sshd -t (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
            Main PID: 1264 (sshd)
            Tasks: 1 (limit: 9445)
            Memory: 2.1M
            CGroup: /system.slice/ssh.service
            └─1264 sshd: /usr/sbin/sshd -D [listener] 0 of 10-100 startups

        that means ssh is installed, otherwise, we can install it by :

            sudo apt update
            sudo apt install openssh-server
            
            sudo systemctl start ssh       # we start ssh in the background
            sudo systemctl enable ssh       # we enable ssh to start at each reboot
            sudo systemctl status ssh       # we check the status of ssh and if there is an error with his execution

    2- Installing Jenkins :

        wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -       # we add the GPG key of the Jenkins repository 
                                                                                                    # (we should get an OK response if everything worked correctly)
        sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'        
                                    # we add the repository link to the sources list directory of ubuntu so we can update Jenkins within other updates automatically
        sudo apt-get update     # we update again ubuntu so we can get the new list of new releases including the last release of Jenkins 
        sudo apt-get install jenkins        # we install jenkins 

    3- We set up Jenkins so he can start automatically with the start of the os:

        sudo systemctl start jenkins        # we start Jenkins in the background
        sudo systemctl enable jenkins       # we enable Jenkins to start at each reboot
        sudo systemctl status jenkins       # we check the status of Jenkins and if there is an error with his execution

    4- we set up the firewall 

        sudo ufw status

        if the firewall is inactive just enable it by :

            sudo ufw enable
        
        if ufw isn't installed on you system you can do so :

            sudo apt install ufw

        sudo ufw allow 8080
        sudo ufw allow ssh

        sudo ufw status     # you should get the followong output (may differe if you have enable some port before)

            Status: active
            Logging: on (low)
            Default: deny (incoming), allow (outgoing), deny (routed)
            New profiles: skip

            To                         Action      From
            --                         ------      ----
            22/tcp                     ALLOW IN    Anywhere                  
            8080                       ALLOW IN    Anywhere                  
            22/tcp (v6)                ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)             
            8080 (v6)                  ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)
        

II- Now, to install Jenkins Plugins

    1- We need to unlock Jenkins by browsing to http://localhost:8080 
    2- there will be a path ( /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword ) which contain the password to unlock jenkins 
    3- then we proceed to customize Jenkins by installing the recommended plugins or selecting the plugin we want (we gonna use the first option in our case) and for the second option we do so:
    3.1- we could install other plugging later on with different methods offline (by using files) or online:
        3.1.1- jenkins cli :
            jenkins-plugin-cli --plugins "the-plugin-we-wawnt":"the-version-of-the-plugin"
        3.1.2- the web UI:
            In the web UI, there is a plugin section where we can check for new plugins or update the ones already installed



III- In this phase we test a freestyle project on jenkins

    - After finishing with the setup of Jenkins we start by choosing a new item in the Jenkins dashboard as shown in /question-3/step1.jpg
    - Then we choose a name for the project also select the Freestyle project as shown in /question-3/step2.png
    - In the general setting, we add a description as shown in /question-3/step3.png
    - In source code management we gonna use a git repository to get the source code of our test as shown in /question-3/step4.png
    - In the build section, we use an execution shell with some java commands to test our build as shown in /question-3/step5.png
    - After applying the changes and saving them we start the build process as we see in /question-3/step6.png
    - The build successfully finished as shown in /question-3/step6.png, we can check the console output for our commands if they successfully run (/question-3/step7.png)
