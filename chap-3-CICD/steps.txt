OS used ==> Ubuntu 20.04
java version used ==> openjdk 11.0.11

I- So to install Jenkins, first, we need to check if java and OpenSSH are installed then we proceed to install Jenkins and enable it to start on each reboot

    1- Check if java and OpenSSH are installed :
    
        ** for java :
            java --version
        
        if the output is like below : 
            
            openjdk 11.0.11 2021-04-20
            OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.11+9-Ubuntu-0ubuntu2.20.04)
            OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 11.0.11+9-Ubuntu-0ubuntu2.20.04, mixed mode, sharing)
        
        that means Java is installed, otherwise, we can install it by :

            sudo apt update     # we update the repositories
            sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk     # we install java (the recommended version for the last release of Jenkins)
            java --version       # we check the installation of java

        ** for ssh :

            sudo systemctl status ssh

        if the output is like below :

            sudo apt update
            sudo apt install openssh-server
            sudo systemctl start ssh
            sudo systemctl enable ssh
            sudo systemctl statut ssh

    2- Installing Jenkins :

        wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -       # we add the GPG key of the Jenkins repository 
                                                                                                    # (we should get an OK response if everything worked correctly)
        sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'        
                                    # we add the repository link to the sources list directory of ubuntu so we can update Jenkins within other updates automatically
        sudo apt-get update     # we update again ubuntu so we can get the new list of new releases including the last release of Jenkins 
        sudo apt-get install jenkins        # we install jenkins 

    3- We set up Jenkins so he can start automatically with the start of the os:

        sudo systemctl start jenkins        # we start Jenkins in the background
        sudo systemctl enable jenkins       # we enable Jenkins to start at each reboot
        sudo systemctl status jenkins       # we check the status of Jenkins and if there is an error with his execution

    4- we set up the firewall 

        sudo ufw status

        if the firewall is inactive just enable it by :

            sudo ufw enable
        
        if ufw isn't installed on you system you can do so :

            sudo apt install ufw

        sudo ufw allow 8080
        sudo ufw allow ssh

        sudo ufw status     # you should get the followong output (may differe if you have enable some port before)

            Status: active
            Logging: on (low)
            Default: deny (incoming), allow (outgoing), deny (routed)
            New profiles: skip

            To                         Action      From
            --                         ------      ----
            22/tcp                     ALLOW IN    Anywhere                  
            8080                       ALLOW IN    Anywhere                  
            22/tcp (v6)                ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)             
            8080 (v6)                  ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)
